# Credit Card Fraud Detection

Anomaly detection on credit card transactions using unsupervised machine learning.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms. The approach uses Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor to identify rare events in highly imbalanced datasets.

---

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset used is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) and contains:

- **Transactions:** ~285,000
- **Features:** 30, including `Time` and `Amount`
- **Fraudulent transactions:** ~0.17%

---

## ⚙️ Methods Used

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
  Basic statistics and distribution of fraudulent vs. valid transactions.
  
- **Anomaly Detection Models**:  
  - **Isolation Forest**: Detects outliers by randomly selecting features and isolating anomalies.
  - **Local Outlier Factor (LOF)**: Detects anomalies based on local neighborhood density.

- **Evaluation Metrics**:  
  Classification report with precision, recall, f1-score, and accuracy.
